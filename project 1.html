<p>As in previous Semester I was taught about the front end development.I liked how using html and css we can make web designing so interesting.So i thought about this nanodegree and why not.
</br></p>
<p>
Bt somehow in between i faced a challenging situation.Despite of all the tension and frustation i keep on saying this to myself that everything that has happened will be ok soon.All the puzzle pieces will surely fit.All the failures and heartbreaking moments were all worth it. No regrets. You were and are and have been and always will be yourself, and thatâ€™s what matters above all.Listen to your tracks.Enjoy your moments.Don't let anything bother you.

My <b>GOALS</b>-well i want to become a succesfull person at first.Also to make my mom and dad proud of me.There are many goals that I hope to achieve. Goals that I feel will define my success as a student, and a professional. The definition of success varies with each person, but to me one of the most essential definitions of a person's success is the impact they have on other people.No matter what i will try to achieve my goals and make my parents proud of me.
